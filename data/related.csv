5,Anyone who doubts the potential influence that movies can have on public opinion need to look no further than two films that are causing an uproar even before they have opened nationwide.,They present hot button issues that manage to fire up people from the left and right.,1
6,"The first, ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" is about the pursuit and killing of Osama bin Laden, which features scenes of torture.","The second, ""Promised Land,"" stars Matt Damon and explores how the use of fracking to drill for natural gas can pose health and environmental dangers.",1
7,"Critics of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden.",They are rightfully concerned that the film will sway some to become more receptive or even supportive of the idea of torturing prisoners.,1

15,"In fact, there's no doubt that the studios behind these movies are overjoyed at the controversy that has erupted and the resulting free press.","Indeed, the response of Sony Pictures to the uproar over ""Zero Dark Thirty"" tells you about what they really hope we will all do: ""We encourage people to see the film before characterizing it.""",1
